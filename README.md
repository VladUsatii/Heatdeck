# Heatdeck
#### Version 1.1.1

Heatdeck was made for the average user to check CPU temperature and measure battery health. The field of AI and machine learning can be very difficult for your machine, and a deck to measure overall heat may benefit you.

Over the next few weeks, new features, such as 'Steps to reduce battery death' or 'Steps to use less CPU' will be added.

One important feature is the ability to press a button and close all idle, unused applications.


### Installation

In version 1, you can get the software using:

```
git clone https://github.com/VladUsatii/Heatdeck.git
